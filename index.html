        <p>I hesitate to call this a blog but a place where I can share my writings and ideas with anyone who wishes to read them.</p>
        <p>My hopes is mainly as an outlet for my creativity, though I would be lying if I didn't hope to find some audience that enjoys what I have to write.</p>
        <p>That aside I also believe without sharing my ideas, praciticing, and getting feedback I will never improve.</p>
        <br>
       <p>With all that said please explore and enjoy as little or as much as you desire.</p>

        <p>Greetings, and salutions voyagers and explorers of the interwebs!</p>
        <p>I am currently outlining a number of ideas and projects to potentially work on in the upcoming days, weeks, and maybe perhaps months. Sometimes it is hard for me to figure out the scale of an idea I have in mind, though I am currently trying to keep my projects to a more manageable size in order to get them out into the world, make edits, get feedback, and hopefully improve.</p>
        <p>With that said, I always appreciate feedback and constructive critism both on what I have written, but also what interests others, as I believe as a general principle a person can only improve so much on their own without exterior feedback. In the vein if like a certain idea or concept I do, I would love to hear from you.</p>
        <p>To add to that point I am considering setting up a concept page where I can list ideas that are brewing in my head to potentially see what people think or might be interested in.</p>
