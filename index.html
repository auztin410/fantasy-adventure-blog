      <div class="body">
        <p>I hesitate to call this a blog but a place where I can share my writings and ideas with anyone who wishes to read them. <br>
        My hopes is mainly as an outlet for my creativity, though I would be lying if I didn't hope to find some audience that enjoys what I have to write. <br>
        That aside I also believe without sharing my ideas, praciticing, and getting feedback I will never improve. <br>
        <br>
        With all that said please explore and enjoy as little or as much as you desire.
