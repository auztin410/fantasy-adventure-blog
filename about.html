        <p>What's there to know about me?</p>
        <p>I have spent much of my professional pursuits chasing after success and challenges, generally in heavily business-related and technology fields, and while I have enjoyed success and growth in these areas I have always been a daydreamer...</p>
        <p>I have only come to realize this past year or so now, that I had been chasing dreams that weren't mine, success and a career that I enjoyed and even had passion for, but never dreamt of doing.</p>
        <p>A wild imagination wouldn't accurately decribe my headspace, my imagination is how I process the world.</p>
        <p>Best to imagine my imagination as a vast forest or jungle having plentiful resources to plunder, but at the risk of getting lost or eaten up by the jungle itself.</p>
        <p>I have struggled to find a creative outlet, and this brings me to here, and this site.</p>
        <p>This is for me to share some of the ideas rattling around in my head.</p>
