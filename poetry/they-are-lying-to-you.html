      <h2 class="title">They Are Lying To You</h2>
      <p class="type">April 6th, 2025</p>

      <p class="subtitle">What if reality was nothing like what your perception of it?</p>
      <p>Reality isn’t what you think…</p>
      <p>Your perception, no! The construction of this reality of yours and the vast majority is a lie.</p>
      <p>Every single piece has been planted and set in place for a purpose.</p>
      <p>And I mean every piece.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You have constructed what the world is like, without ever really seeing it, of events, and what people are like that you have never met.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It is all fabricated a lie stacked upon a lie.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The layers of these lies run deep and some have transcended lies themselves…</p>
      <p>What do I mean by that? When is a lie no longer required?</p>
      <p>When no one questions a thing anymore.</p>
      <p>Working for someone else, working after hours, when you do what you believe, what you were </p>
      <p>made to believe is right, you no longer need to lie.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You believe it as fact, some require more lies and others less, that vacation or retirement perhaps, a fabrication that you will never see.</p>
      <br>
      <p>While others require lies of what reality is.</p>
      <p>Requiring the knowledge that good triumphs over evil.</p>
      <p>That there is more good in this world than bad.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now what if I told you that was all made up?</p>
      <p>Set up to keep you where you are right now.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You likely wouldn’t care.</p>
      <p>You no longer need the lies.</p>
      <p>You accept because it is what you were made to do.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I cannot free your mind of this, I cannot shine a light upon the truth.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Not because I have no light or truth, but because you would simply…</p>
      <br>
      <p>Squint and turn away. So adverse to the light, such a foreign thing it is to you.</p>
