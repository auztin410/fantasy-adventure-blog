      <p class="subtitle">A Dark Dystopian Story - Taking the concept of "The Grind" to a whole other level.</p>

      <div class="body">
        <p>It's funny how life works out, how the thing you once wished for is the thing that keeps you  awake at night now, sometimes waking up in a cold sweat at the horror of the reality that is our modern lives.</p>

        <p>You are alright, it was a dream… Nothing is going to happen to you… You repeat to yourself a mantra of sorts. The only thin sheet of logic that allows you wrangle your sanity back from the edge. I am safe… I don’t go out late at night and I keep my head down and only go out where I need to during the day when it's safe, well at least safe from ending up as an ingredient in Greg’s Meats.</p>

        <p>Safety is something to hold on tight to, when it is something that isn’t given these days… I don’t have much like everyone else, but I make it by. It isn’t a happy and comfortable reality but I am same when I am home and the area I live in isn’t bad comparatively speaking, there are still small ‘bastions’ here and there, small neighborhoods where the few people barely riding the razor’s edge of getting a glimpse of the light, not living debt at the very least, but that’s all not enough to ever change their lives.</p>

        <p>Some people crack from the reality of it, the soulless and intelligence crushing jobs that still exist seem only to exist to put  the worst people in management to suppress and keep us workers too afraid and traumatized to react to the reality.</p>

        <p>Broken down, no fight left in us, to stand up and stick out is to be left without means, without a job, without shelter, without safety… You don’t want to be out after dark anywhere now, it is a jungle out there, due to the ease and value of a human body someone can make, there is a lot of meat and products that can be made from the body, and what once was considered a story blown out of proportion soon became the sad reality.</p>

        <p>In this world you take what you can get and it isn’t uncommon to snatched up and brought to the nearby rendering plant for Greg’s Meats, A few hundred dollars and no questions asked, it was like free money if you could stomach the idea of dooming some poor person to be processed into some meat paste mixture just because he worked a bit too late… The rendering plant had a big sign, no worn with time that read.</p>
